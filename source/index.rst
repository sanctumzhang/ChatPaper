.. warning::

      ChatPaper does not support inethical use of the tool. Please use the tool responsibly. In order to reduce academic ethics risks, we have added complex text injection to Chat_Reviewer, as shown in the example image. We hope that teachers and students will pay attention to academic ethics and academic reputation when using the tool, and not misuse it. If anyone has a better way to limit the non-standard use of the tool, please leave a message and contribute to the research community.
